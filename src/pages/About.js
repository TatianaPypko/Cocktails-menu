        Because as much as you love good design and inspiring illustrations, you
        also want to meet the people that curate all the content for you.
        Furthermore, itâ€™s equally rewarding when you realize that they are just
        as eager to start a visual dialogue with you. Nathan Strandberg and
        Katie Kirk are doing what makes them happy, and this is obvious
        throughout their page.
